### ðŸ§  Moral of the Story

Every bug fixed, every error solved, and every line of code improved is a step forward in becoming a better developer.  
This project reminded me that real growth happens when I face issues head-on, ask questions, and stay curious.  
From making a custom hook to polishing UI with Tailwind, this small project turned into a big lesson in **patience**, **problem-solving**, and **persistence**.
