# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Moral of the story

* A project called counter.
* which have two buttons "increase" and "decrease".
* one display text which dispay the increment or decrement.
* it is going to be easy.

### learnings:
 * what is hooks.
 * how can we implement.
 * how to propogate changes
 * syntax and other about useState
